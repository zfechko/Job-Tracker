# Job Application Tracker

## Description
This is a simple job application tracker that I'm making to knock off some rust using Python and PostgreSQL.

The project will start out just as an application in the terminal utilizing the [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library, but I plan to expand it to have a full GUI using PyQt5 or some other visual framework like streamlit.
